To make the dataset more manageable without losing our ability to conduct meaningful analysis, we could extract the Month-Year from timestamp column that records the date and time of each record in POSIXct format.

We will do this by plotting the mean, maximum, and minimum total_amount earned/spent from all participants, grouped by category and month_year, over month_year.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the mean, minimum, and maximum total_amount over all participantId for each category\ngrouped_data_summary &lt;- grouped_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(category, month_year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_total_amount = mean(abs(total_amount)),\n            min_total_amount = min(abs(total_amount)),\n            max_total_amount = max(abs(total_amount)))\n\n# Create a time series plot with mean, min, and max for each category using facets\nggplot(grouped_data_summary, aes(x = month_year, y = mean_total_amount, color = category)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = min_total_amount, ymax = max_total_amount, fill = category), alpha = 0.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Month/Year\", y = \"Amount ($)\",\n       title = \"Mean/Max/Min Amount by Category over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"RentAdjustment and Wage are earnings, the rest are expenses\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Category\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Category\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  facet_wrap(~category, nrow = 3, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  guides(color = \"none\", fill = \"none\") +\n  scale_x_datetime(date_minor_breaks = \"1 month\", date_labels = \"%b-%Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the mean, minimum, and maximum amounts for each category is relatively stable over time. The exceptions are:\n\nShelter and RentAdjustment experience ‘shocks’ on Mar-2022, and the effects linger for a month until Apr-2022, after which Shelter stabilises while RentAdjustment becomes zero.\nMinor ‘shock’ for Wage on Mar-2022 as well.\nHigh volatility for the maximum amount spent on Recreation over time. This makes sense as it is most likely spending on luxury items, as compared to the other expense categories, which are more like necessities (e.g., Education, Food, Shelter).\n\nSince most of the time series are relatively stable, we can move on to conduct our analysis on aggregated data (aggregated over time). This removes one dimension from the analysis, making it less complicated."

The higher the educationLevel, the higher the monthly wage. However, all variables do not seem to have any clear relationship with joviality (points are evenly spread out across the y-axis).\nThere is no clear relationship between joviality and monthly wage. Money is not correlated with happiness (at least for this sample of participants)."
